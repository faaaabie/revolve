This folder contains the files that were used to create the data for the Evolutionary Computing research assignment by group C. 
The run-experiments files were used to get the final results for 10 repetitions.

All the measures were extracted from the files that were created with the run-experiments files, by running consolidate_experiments.py. Additionally, the file consolidate_experiments_clauses.py was used to create a new descriptor: number of true clauses.
Figures were made using the R files to compare within one experiments the two environments: summary_measures_intermethods.R, and to compare one environment between two experiments: summary_measures_intramethods_plane.R and summary_measures_intramethods_tilted.R.
A figure showing the best robot of each run was made using the best_robots.R file.
